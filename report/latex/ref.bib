abstract = {Regarding the optimisation of adhesive lap joints, several authors have proposed the use of adhesive spews (i.e. shoulders of adhesive connecting the unloaded ends of the adherends) and of chamfers at the ends of the adherends to reduce stress concentrations. Considering a hybrid joint between steel and FRP, this paper analyses in detail the effect of such solutions on the stress field, in order to identify the optimal condition and to assess design rules. It has been found that spew and chamfer angles of about 45° are sufficient to obtain a considerable reduction of the stress peaks.}

keywords = {Electric vehicles, Range anxiety, Reactionary rhetoric, Diffusion of innovation},
abstract = {“Range anxiety,” defined as the psychological anxiety a consumer experiences in response to the limited range of an electric vehicle, continues to be labelled and presented as one of the most pressing barriers to their mainstream diffusion. As a result, academia, policymakers and even industry have focused on addressing the range anxiety barrier in order to accelerate adoption. Much literature recognizes that range anxiety is increasingly psychological, rather than technical, in its nature. However, we argue in this paper that even psychological and technical explanations are incomplete. We examine range anxiety through Hirschman’s Rhetoric of Reaction, which supposes that conservative forces may oppose change by propagating theses related to jeopardy, perversity, and futility. To do so, we use three qualitative methods to understand the role of range anxiety triangulated via a variety of perspectives: 227 semi-structured interviews with experts at 201 institutions, a survey with nearly 5000 respondents, and 8 focus groups, all across 17 cities in the five Nordic countries. We find evidence where consumers and experts use and perpetuate the rhetoric of reaction, particularly the jeopardy thesis. We conclude with a reexamination of the policies geared to assuage range-based barriers, which a construction of range anxiety as a rhetorical excuse would render as ineffective or inefficient, as well as future implications for diffusion theory.}

abstract = {Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offer the potential to reduce both oil imports and greenhouse gas emissions, but have a limited utility due to factors including driver range anxiety and access to charging infrastructure. In this paper we apply NREL's Battery Lifetime Analysis and Simulation Tool for Vehicles (BLAST-V) to examine the sensitivity of BEV utility to range anxiety and different charging infrastructure scenarios, including variable time schedules, power levels, and locations (home, work, and public installations). We find that the effects of range anxiety can be significant, but are reduced with access to additional charging infrastructure. We also find that (1) increasing home charging power above that provided by a common 15 A, 120 V circuit offers little added utility, (2) workplace charging offers significant utility benefits to select high mileage commuters, and (3) broadly available public charging can bring many lower mileage drivers to near-100% utility while strongly increasing the achieved miles of high mileage drivers.}

This study reviews standardization research in terms of the process of standardization, innovation, and the demand-supply perspective. It draws implications that standards will be one of the important tools for national economic growth and for unconventional strategies of businesses. The analyses, based on the demand-supply framework, finally suggest promising opportunities for potential researchers.}
