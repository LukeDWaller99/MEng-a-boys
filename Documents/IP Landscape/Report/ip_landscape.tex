\subsubsection{Search Strategies}
\textbf{Strategy 1}\\
Using the advanced search functionality of espacenet to filter results based on a search terms inclusion in just the title, the phrase “magnetic” and “break away” was used and returned a single patent.
Similar combinations with less strict filters returned more results, with “parallel” AND “cable” AND “magnetic” returning 29 results. \\
\textbf{Strategy 2}\\
An alternate strategy was attempted, by placing emphasis on the break-away/pull-apart functionality of the connector. This led to the following results:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{1.5pt}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.7\linewidth}|c|}
    \hline
    \cellcolor{gray!40}Search Term & \cellcolor{gray!40}No. of Results \\
    \hline
    ti = “magnetic” AND (ti any “break away” OR ti any “pull apart”) & 508 \\
    \hline
    ti = “magnetic” AND (ti any “break away” OR ti any “pull apart”) AND ti = “Connector” & 5 \\
    \hline
    ti = “magnetic” AND (ti any “break away” OR ti any “pull apart”) AND ti = “Connector” AND (ctxt = “electrical” OR ctxt = “electronic”) & 2 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Breakaway Connector Search Terms 1}
    \label{table:breakaway_connector_search_strat_2}
\end{table}
Of the two patents found at the conclusion of this search strategy, only one had relevance to the project. Despite use of logic OR statements to look for synonyms and word variants, this search strategy was overly specialised and too narrow. To remedy this, a third strategy was employed.\\

\textbf{Strategy 3}

    \label{table:mag_con1}
\end{table}
\textbf{Claim 1}\\
Claim 1 describes a magnetic coupling system that utilises two round connectors with a magnetic element in the centre. One connector is concave, the other is convex, and so the two halves fit together, held in-place by the magnet. Each half can spin independently of the other, as the single magnet provides no rotational locking.
Whilst the magnetic break away connector that HEVCS will employ shares the same male/female aspect with a single magnetic locking pin, the HEVCS connector will not share the rotational symmetry that the connector specified in the patent does. Additionally, the patent describes a mechanical coupling device. The HEVCS connector will be connecting the control unit to the mobile platform by way of a 16-pin parallel cable, differing in that it will be a data cable and not a purely mechanical coupling.

\textbf{Claim 2}\\
Claim 18 is identical in content to Claim 1, and so for the reasons outlined above, will not be a factor in infringement.

\textbf{Summary}\\
In summary, the HEVCS design will not infringe this patent, as it does not violate either of the two independent claims. It should be noted, however, that while this patent is valid only in the US, it is active and being upheld by a major US corporation, and so would be a high risk for litigation should infringement occur.

\textbf{Claims}

A device for climbing stairs comprising: A carrier body for transporting a payload,Ladder Frame, A mechanism between the stepped frame and the carrier body, The mechanism is configured to move the stepped frame in relation to the carrier body in a circular path.

The HEVCS does not contain two individual parts that move in relation to each other in a circular motion.
This means that this patent is not relevant to the HEVCS platform and there does not impede the patent.

The stair climbing device comprises of a main body portion and an outer hanging portion, forming an L shaped design.
The HEVCS is not an L shaped design comprising of two exactly different body portions. Therefore, the HEVCS platform does not encroach on this patent.

\textbf{Claims}

A device for transporting payloads over varying terrain, the device comprises: a first round of clustering of three wheels contained in a flat configuration, a second round of clusters of three wheels contained in a planar configuration.
The HEVCS will not use a cluster of three wheels to allow the platform to move up and down stairs. Therefore, this does not encroach on this patent.
Given that this claim only has one independent claim, outlining the use of three clustered wheels, this patent is not being impeded by the HEVCS platform.

    \label{table:step_Kerb_nav_st_5}
\end{table}

\textbf{Claims}

This patent contains three independent claims which are almost identical, except for a few minor differences throughout.
The first independent claim outlines a structural base having a chassis and a weight bearing top, a pair of laterally opposed front axles, a pair of lateral opposed rear axles and a pair of longitudinal intermediate axles between the front and rear axles. Each axle has a bi-directional wheel attached to it, with each wheel having at least one attachment to the hub, spokes connecting the hub in a radial direction, and a circumferential ring attached to the end of the spokes. There are multiple cylindrical rollers mounted onto each of these rings such that they are free to rotate. A pair of opposing drive trains will be utilised upon demand to drive the wheels. An intermediate drive train will also be utilised to rotate each of the bidirectional wheels on command. An electrical storage method is used within the chassis for supplying the drive trains with power, controlled by an electric controller.
The HEVCS utilises mecanum wheels, like those explained above in claim 1 along with a suitable battery and electronic controller system. Despite this, the patent is not infringed because the HEVCS will not have longitudinally mounted axels.
The other claims (claim 18 and claim 19), were like the first independent claim but differed in wording and subtle content.
Claim 18 discusses a means to propel and remotely guide the platform. The HEVCS platform utilises a tethered connection and so will not be remotely controlled therefore does not infringe on this claim.
Claim 19 is almost identical to claim 1 but is missing some detail.
As we do not infringe on the first independent claim, we also do not infringe on this claim.
This patent is also expired meaning that even if the HEVCS platform did infringe on the patent it would not be affected.
