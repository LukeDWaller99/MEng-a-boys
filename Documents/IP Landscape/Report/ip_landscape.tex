\section{Patent Research}\label{sec:patent_research}
When performing research into the IP landscape surrounding a project, it is important to filter patents to only include relevant results. As one of leading patent databases, Espacenet was used to find patents. One of the most helpful features of Espacenet is the advanced search features available, with support for Boolean logic as well as filtering based on report section. 

These features were used liberally, with each search strategy making use of Boolean OR statements to include equivalent terms or variants of a word. Given that a large number of patents are translated into English, alternate word choices were important as translations are not always optimal. Another filtering method was to filter based on words within the title; title and abstract; or all text within the document. This helped to further filter results by ignoring uses of words in non-relevant sections. In some cases, an exclusionary NOT term was added, to ignore specific terms that appeared in non-relevant results.

The objective of each search was to lower the number of relevant results to approximately ten, and then to survey the results in detail for any risk of infringement. 

\subsection{Under Vehicle Technology}\label{sec:under_vehilce_technology}
\subsection{Breakaway Connectors}\label{sec:breakaway_connectors}
\subsubsection{Search Strategies}
\textbf{Strategy 1}\\
Using the advanced search functionality of espacenet to filter results based on a search terms inclusion in just the title, the phrase “magnetic” and “break away” was used and returned a single patent. 
Similar combinations with less strict filters returned more results, with “parallel” AND “cable” AND “magnetic” returning 29 results. \\
\textbf{Strategy 2}\\
An alternate strategy was attempted, by placing emphasis on the break-away/pull-apart functionality of the connector. This led to the following results:
\begin{table}[H]

    \setlength{\arrayrulewidth}{1.5pt}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.7\linewidth}|c|}
    \hline

    ti = “magnetic” AND (ti any “break away” OR ti any “pull apart”) AND ti = “Connector” & 5 \\

    ti = “magnetic” AND (ti any “break away” OR ti any “pull apart”) AND ti = “Connector” AND (ctxt = “electrical” OR ctxt = “electronic”) & 2 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Breakaway Connector Search Terms 1}
    \label{table:breakaway_connector_search_strat_2}
\end{table}
Of the two patents found at the conclusion of this search strategy, only one had relevance to the project. Despite use of logic OR statements to look for synonyms and word variants, this search strategy was overly specialised and too narrow. To remedy this, a third strategy was employed.\\

\end{table}
\textbf{Claim 1}\\
Claim 1 describes a magnetic coupling system that utilises two round connectors with a magnetic element in the centre. One connector is concave, the other is convex, and so the two halves fit together, held in-place by the magnet. Each half can spin independently of the other, as the single magnet provides no rotational locking.
Whilst the magnetic break away connector that HEVCS will employ shares the same male/female aspect with a single magnetic locking pin, the HEVCS connector will not share the rotational symmetry that the connector specified in the patent does. Additionally, the patent describes a mechanical coupling device. The HEVCS connector will be connecting the control unit to the mobile platform by way of a 16-pin parallel cable, differing in that it will be a data cable and not a purely mechanical coupling.

\textbf{Claim 2}\\
Claim 18 is identical in content to Claim 1, and so for the reasons outlined above, will not be a factor in infringement.

\textbf{Summary}\\
In summary, the HEVCS design will not infringe this patent, as it does not violate either of the two independent claims. It should be noted, however, that while this patent is valid only in the US, it is active and being upheld by a major US corporation, and so would be a high risk for litigation should infringement occur.

\end{table}

\textbf{Claim 1}\\
Claim 1 describes a matching pair of magnetic connectors for a low-voltage data transmission cable. The connectors will use a toggleable electromagnetic coupling system in order to align the connectors and ensure constant connectivity, as well as allowing for intentional disconnection by deactivating the electromagnets.
HEVCS’ connector design will use magnets for alignment and maintaining connection, however, these will be standard always-on magnets, lacking the toggle on/off functionality that the claim outlines. The HEVCS connector uses the magnets to provide a baseline holding force, that in a runaway event will come disconnected without injuring the user. These cannot be de/remagnetised at will, unlike electromagnets, thus this claim is not infringed. 
\textbf{Summary}\\
Despite apparent similarities in the use of magnetic forces to hold a data connector in place, this patent is not infringed due to the differing methods of implementation. Being granted in 2020, this is a recent patent held by a major corporate entity, and so infringement should be expected to result in litigation. However, as the only active jurisdiction is the US, infringement is not a concern at this time.
Masimo Corporation produce medical technology products, and this specific patent is for use in a medical pulse oximeter. This has no need for the enhanced safety features built into the HEVCS’ connector, the disconnect at will feature being much more important to this specific application.

    \caption{Patent information}
    \label{table:mag_con3}
\end{table}
\textbf{Claim 1}\\
As the only independent claim for this patent – acting a root claim for all dependant claims thereafter – claim 1 describes the overall structure of the connector. The connector described is a series of connectors for a data line, each connector servicing a single line. The novel feature is a series of semi-circular magnetic connection mechanisms, that allow for any number of these connectors to be connected in a parallel fashion.
Whilst in principle, this connector is a magnetic parallel data connector like the HEVCS connector, the actual implementation differs greatly in both manner and purpose. The HEVCS connector utilises magnets to providing a holding force, to keep the connector in position. This patent uses magnets to keep connectors in a parallel arrangement, with the advantage that n connectors can be connected in parallel.
The HEVCS connector will additionally be cylindrical, with parallel data lines arranged around a central magnet. The described connector within this patent uses a linear arrangement for its data lines.

\textbf{Summary}\\
The jurisdictional limits of this patent to China, and the large differences in data line arrangement and connector style mean that this patent is not, and shall not be, infringed by the HEVCS connector. Whilst the patent contains a novel idea for connector construction and arrangement, due to the demands placed on the HEVCS connector, these ideas are not applicable.

    \caption{Patent information}
    \label{table:mag_con4}
\end{table}
\textbf{Claim 1}\\
Claim 1 provides a description for style of magnetic connector utilising magnets to establish the connection. The connector specified here shares some similarities with the HEVCS connector, namely the use of parallel circuit boards within the connector. As this claim could be infringed, the other independent claims must be analysed.

\textbf{Claim 10}\\
Claim 10 specifies that the connector has either one or seven pins. The HEVCS connector will be making use of 10 pins, thus this claim is uninfringed.

\textbf{Summary}\\
This patent comes closest to infringement, as the connector is described using very broad terms, however, the number of pins differs, and the overall body of the design is different. This patent is active, although information about legal events is sparse. The likelihood of the patent remaining active cannot be estimated, however jurisdictional limits mean that litigation is unlikely.

The ‘U’ at the end of the patent number signifies that this is a utility model, as opposed to a full patent. A utility model generally has less stringent requirements for the size of the inventive step demonstrated. Additionally, utility models are much quicker to grant, and can be used to protect small inventions or improvements upon existing designs. In China, utility models last for 10 years.

\end{table}
\textbf{Claim 1}

Claim 1 is the only independent claim of this patent, and describes the connector covered by the patent. Two large differences are visible between the described connector and the HEVCS connect. The first being the shape of the connector; The described connector is rectangular with the male end being a ‘card’ shape. The HEVCS connector will be round with a ‘pin’ style connection on the male end.
The second difference is the method of manufacture. The described connector’s housing will be injection moulded. For the HEVCS prototype, the connector housing will be 3D printed out of ABS plastic, to keep costs low and enable rapid prototyping. 

\textbf{Summary}

As explained above, this patent is a utility model, providing similar protections as a full-scale patent at a reduced cost and timeframe. This patent is still active, however standard jurisdictional limits apply. The chance of infringing this patent is low due to the inherent differences in both connector design and manufacturing process between this patent and the HEVCS connector.

\textbf{Claims}

A device for climbing stairs comprising: A carrier body for transporting a payload,Ladder Frame, A mechanism between the stepped frame and the carrier body, The mechanism is configured to move the stepped frame in relation to the carrier body in a circular path.

The HEVCS does not contain two individual parts that move in relation to each other in a circular motion. This means that this patent is not relevant to the HEVCS platform and there does not impede the patent.

The stair climbing device comprises of a main body portion and an outer hanging portion, forming an L shaped design.
The HEVCS is not an L shaped design comprising of two exactly different body portions. Therefore, the HEVCS platform does not encroach on this patent.
